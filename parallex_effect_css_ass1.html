    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Taj Mahal is an Islamic religious building, mosque and tomb built in the 17th century by king Shah Jahan in memory of his wife, Mumtaz Mahal. 
    Its chief architect was Ustad Ahmad Lahauri.The building is in the city of Agra, Uttar Pradesh. 
    Widely thought as one of the most beautiful buildings in the world, it is one of India's biggest tourist 
    attractions.It is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, together with the Agra Fort, 2.5 kilometers away. 
    It was listed as one of the 7 Wonders of the World in 2007. It is located on the south bank of Yamuna river in Agra. 
    It is a splendid monument, but because of pollution, the Taj Mahal is turning yellow. It Is one of the most notable Islamic 
    architectures built by the Mughals in India.</p>
    
     <div><h3>Construction</h3>
    <p class="pic1">The Taj Mahal is an example of Muslim Architecture â€“ a mixture of building design influenced from Middle Eastern, 
        Indian, Turkish, and Ottoman architecture.
        The Taj Mahal was constructed with materials from all over the world, and over 20,000 people were used 
        to move building materials. It is generally thought that Ustad Ahmad Lahauri was in charge of the 
        construction. The construction was finished in 1648. The construction of Taj Mahal is about 6000 
        feet..</p>

    <div><h3>Tours</h3>
    <p class="pic2"></p>
    <p>The Taj Mahal had 2 million visitors in 2001 and in 2014-2017 there are more than 7-8 million visitors.</p></div>
    <div><h3>Damages</h3>
    <p class="pic3">Many people think it is one of the most beautiful buildings ever built. 
        However, it is slowly being damaged by acid rain in the nearby Yamuna Basin. 
        A nearby oil refinery has been blamed for some of the damage. In 1996, the Indian Supreme Court 
        said that local industry was harming the Taj Mahal. The court set up an area of 10,400 square 
        meters around the Taj Mahal called the Taj Trapezium Zone. Industries within this zone must use 
        natural gas instead of coal.
        Because of pollution Taj Mahal is getting yellower slowly.</p>
